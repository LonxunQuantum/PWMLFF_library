# **models**

We provide models trained with dp and dp type embedding.

For example:
```
dp/
------------/dp_model.cpkt
------------/epoch_train.dat
------------/epoch_valid.dat
------------/train_valid_loss.png
```

`"train_valid_loss.png"` shows the decreasing trend of the training and valid loss during model training. The data is sourced from the `"epoch_train.dat"` and `"epoch_valid.dat"` files in the same directory.
